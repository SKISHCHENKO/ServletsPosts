## The Java Servlet application## 


### 1. Servlet###  
Servlets: The entry point for handling HTTP requests and responses. Servlets extend HttpServlet and override methods like doGet,
doPost, doDelete, and doPut to handle specific types of requests. They process incoming data, interact with the service layer,
and generate the response to be sent back to the client.

### 2. Controller###  
Controllers: Often implemented as separate classes (e.g., PostController), controllers manage the application's business logic
and coordinate between the servlet layer and the service layer. They handle user requests, validate input, and call the appropriate
 service methods.

### 3. Service ###  
Services: This layer contains the business logic of the application (e.g., PostService). Services perform operations like creating,
 reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) entities. They may include validation, data transformation, and other business rules.

### 4. Repository###  
Repositories: This layer is responsible for data access. Repositories (e.g., PostRepository) interact with the database or in-memory
data structures to perform CRUD operations on the underlying data models. They typically encapsulate the logic for data retrieval and
 storage, making it easier to switch between different data sources if needed.

### 5. Model###  
Models: The data structures used to represent the application's entities (e.g., Post). Models contain properties (fields) and methods
 relevant to the data they represent, usually corresponding to database tables or documents.
 
### 6. Exception###  
Custom Exceptions: Application-specific exceptions (e.g., NotFoundException) provide meaningful error messages and facilitate error
handling across the application. Exception handling mechanisms ensure that the application can gracefully manage errors and provide
informative feedback to users or clients.
